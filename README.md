The player must survive waves of Phantoms and Wendigos during the night, during the day the player can purchase upgrades, traps and prepare for the next attack. The player must protect themselves and the fireplace. A boss fight will mark every 5th wave. Each night the difficulty will ramp up and eventually when defeated the player can restart the current night or view their stats.
